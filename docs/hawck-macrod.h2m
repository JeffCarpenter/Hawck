[description]
Listen for keys coming from InputD and run Lua scripts
to modify the behaviour of these keys.

This daemon is meant to be interacted with by using
hawck-ui.

[files]

$HOME/.local/share/hawck/scripts
    Contains user hwk scripts, as well as the Lua files generated from
    them.

$HOME/.local/share/hawck/scripts-enabled
    Contains symlinks to Lua scripts, putting Lua files in here with
    execute permissions will cause them to be loaded instantly by
    MacroD.

$HOME/.local/share/hawck/lua-comm.fifo
    FIFO that MacroD listens on, writes to this fifo should be a length (32 bit
    unsigned int) followed by Lua code. This Lua code can either query or set
    values in the `config' object.

$HOME/.local/share/hawck/json-comm.fifo
    FIFO that MacroD writes to, reads to this should be performed
    after a write to `lua-comm.fifo' and will result in a length
    (32 bit unsigned int) followed by a JSON object.

$HOME/.local/share/hawck/cfg.lua
    Contains configuration options that can be set and queried
    from $HOME/.local/share/hawck/*-comm.fifo.

$HOME/.local/share/hawck/macrod.log
    Misc. logs from MacroD, not meant for users. Use journalctl(1)
    or an alternative syslog viewer to view the MacroD logs.

/var/lib/hawck-input/kbd.sock
    Is the socket that MacroD will listen on for connections from
    InputD.
