.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Listen to keyboard devices and pass whitelisted input over to
hawck-macrod.
.PP
Hawck InputD works in two modes:
.IP "1." 3
Listening on all keyboards
.IP \[bu] 2
The default, in this mode hawck-inputd will grab all keyboard devices
when it starts up.
It will also automatically grab the keyboard input of any keyboards that
are plugged in while running.
.IP "2." 3
Listening on only a few specific keyboards
.IP \[bu] 2
Hawck InputD works in this mode when it is given at least one keyboard
with the \f[B]--kbd-device\f[R], as well as \f[B]--no-hotplug\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Keyboards that were initially provided using \f[B]--kbd-device\f[R] are
not affected by \f[B]--no-hotplug\f[R], they can still be removed and
re-attached.
