/* FIXME: Sticky key
 *
 * If a key (like enter) is pressed as the program is started, the desktop environment
 * does not seem to receive the key-up properly. The result is that the key becomes unusable
 * while Hawck is running.
 *
 * The bug can also be reproduced with the following code:
 *   match[ up + key "s" ] = function()end
 *
 * When the 's' key is pressed the key-up will be hidden from the desktop environment
 * and the key becomes unusable no matter how many times it is pressed. This one should
 * be fixable by just faking another key-up event. However,
 *
 * Faking key-ups does not seem to work with keys that were originally received from a
 * physical keyboard. The problem seems to be that DEs like GNOME expect the key-up to
 * come from the same device as the key-down. This is illustrated by the following:
 *   Press and hold key on keyboard 0
 *   Press and hold the same key on keyboard 1
 *   Release key on either keyboard and the key will still be repeated.
 * This is what indicates that GNOME expects the key-up to come from the same keyboard.
 *
 * Workaround:
 *   When starting up, wait for a keypress using select()
 *   When a key is pressed, wait for the keyup.
 *   When the SYN for the keyup is received, lock the keyboard.
 * This should resolve the bug.
 * 
 * FIXME: UPDATE
 * 
 * The workaround has now been implemented inside `Keyboard::lock` and is working
 * as intended for single keypresses.

/* TODO: Multiple Lua scripts
 *
 * ev should run as a daemon, and should be able to receive commands
 * to load Lua scripts or just add a new key-matching pattern.
 *
 * How commands should be received:
 *   D-Bus:
 *     Should be easy to work with on the client side.
 *   FIFO:
 *     Requires thinking more about protocol, but will
 *     be supported everywhere.
 *   TCP/IP:
 *     Bad idea.
 *
 * What commands to implement:
 *   loadScript(path :: string, name :: string)
 *   exec(script :: string, code :: string)
 *   stopScript(script :: string)
 *   addKeyboard(path :: string)
 *   removeKeyboard(path :: string)
 *   // Stop listening for events, free the keyboard
 *   stop()
 *   // Start again
 *   start()
 *   // Stop daemon entirely
 *   kill()
 *     
 * A Python script will be written for controlling the daemon.
 * It should be called "hawctrl" and should work like this
 *   hawctrl --load=path/to/<script-name>.hwk
 *   hawctrl --stop
 *   hawctrl --stop-script=script-name
 *   hawctrl --start
 *   hawctrl --kill
 *   hawctrl --exec="print('hello')" --script=script-name
 *   hawctrl --add-kbd=/path/to/kbd/device
 *   hawctrl --rm-kbd=/path/to/kbd/device
