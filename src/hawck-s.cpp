/* FIXME: Sticky key
 *
 * If a key (like enter) is pressed as the program is started, the desktop environment
 * does not seem to receive the key-up properly. The result is that the key becomes unusable
 * while Hawck is running.
 *
 * The bug can also be reproduced with the following code:
 *   match[ up + key "s" ] = function()end
 *
 * When the 's' key is pressed the key-up will be hidden from the desktop environment
 * and the key becomes unusable no matter how many times it is pressed. This one should
 * be fixable by just faking another key-up event. However,
 *
 * Faking key-ups does not seem to work with keys that were originally received from a
 * physical keyboard. The problem seems to be that DEs like GNOME expect the key-up to
 * come from the same device as the key-down. This is illustrated by the following:
 *   Press and hold key on keyboard 0
 *   Press and hold the same key on keyboard 1
 *   Release key on either keyboard and the key will still be repeated.
 * This is what indicates that GNOME expects the key-up to come from the same keyboard.
 *
 * Workaround:
 *   When starting up, wait for a keypress using select()
 *   When a key is pressed, wait for the keyup.
 *   When the SYN for the keyup is received, lock the keyboard.
 * This should resolve the bug.
 * 
 * FIXME: UPDATE
 * 
 * The workaround has now been implemented inside `Keyboard::lock` and is working
 * as intended for single keypresses.

/* TODO: Multiple Lua scripts
 *
 * ev should run as a daemon, and should be able to receive commands
 * to load Lua scripts or just add a new key-matching pattern.
 *
 * How commands should be received:
 *   D-Bus:
 *     Should be easy to work with on the client side.
 *   FIFO:
 *     Requires thinking more about protocol, but will
 *     be supported everywhere.
 *   TCP/IP:
 *     Bad idea.
 *
 * What commands to implement:
 *   loadScript(path :: string, name :: string)
 *   exec(script :: string, code :: string)
 *   stopScript(script :: string)
 *   addKeyboard(path :: string)
 *   removeKeyboard(path :: string)
 *   // Stop listening for events, free the keyboard
 *   stop()
 *   // Start again
 *   start()
 *   // Stop daemon entirely
 *   kill()
 *     
 * A Python script will be written for controlling the daemon.
 * It should be called "haw" and should work like this
 *   haw --load=path/to/<script-name>.hwk
 *   haw --stop
 *   haw --stop-script=script-name
 *   haw --start
 *   haw --kill
 *   haw --exec="print('hello')" --script=script-name
 *   haw --add-kbd=/path/to/kbd/device

 */

/* TODO: Security
 *
 * The user running ev needs to be a part of the input group in order
 * to read from the keyboard. Some might consider this a security risk,
 * particularly Wayland devs/proponents.
 *
 * Here's how everything should be split up:
 *   Scripts are owned by root and require sudo to replace, they are
 *   globally readable however. Stored in /usr/share/hawck/scripts/,
 *   with libraries stored in /usr/share/hawck/libs/
 *   installed using:
 *     sudo haw --install-script /path/to/script.hwk
 *     sudo haw --install-library /path/to/library.lua
 *
 *   ev:
 *     Runs under ev-listen user, which is part of the input group
 *     Loads scripts and checks for which keys should be passed on.
 *     Exposes keyboards in FIFOs like this:
 *       /tmp/ev-listen/kbd0
 *       /tmp/ev-listen/kbd1
 *     Has UDev for echoing back keys that are not on the whitelist.
 *     With the group ev-connect, writes binary data directly from
 *     the keyboard (but with whitelisting of keys.)
 *   Hawck:
 *     Started as root, will add the ev-connect group and drop priviliges
 *     to user mode.
 *     If started as a regular user, it will assume that it can read
 *     from the keyboard by itself.
 *     Runs under the desktop user.
 *     Has UDev for echoing back keys that did not match any patterns.
 *     Loads scripts just like ev.
 *     Listens for keypresses that come from ev, gives them to Lua,
 *     and runs __event() to see if it should echo the key back.
 *
 * Effectively this means that super-user privilges are required
 * to decide which keys are allowed to get intercepted. But the
 * scripts actually run under the user like he/she would expect.
 *
 * There should be a way to disable all of this to make the system
 * easier to work with.
 *
 * Scripts can opt to receive ALL keys by declaring the following:
 *   receive "*"
 *
 * One problem with all of this is increased latency when pressing
 * keys, which further emphasizes the need for this additional
 * security to be optional.
 *
 * Another alternative is to create a shared memory segment using
 * mmap and then fork/exec, that might make it very viable. This
 * solution also avoids having two separate executables.
 *
 * It should be started like:
 *   sudo hawck
 * Then the process will create a shared memory segment for IPC
 * and fork twice into the event listener and the event evaluator.
 * The listener will run under the ev-listen user and the event
 * evaluator will run under the desktop user, no events are filtered,
 * everything is passed through as we are relying on the scripts
 * not doing anything phishy. In this model events don't really need
 * to be filtered as we are trusting that scripts are stored with
 * mode 644 and are owned by the root user.
 *
 * Filtering could still be implemented purely for the sake of
 * performance.
 *
 * Now the user can also configure hawck to load scripts from
 * ~/.local/share/hawck/scripts/ to avoid having to use sudo for installing
 * scripts, though this will leave the user open to keylogging
 * hawck scripts being installed it is still very useful for quick
 * development of hawck scripts.
 *
 * This should be enabled/disabled with:
 *   sudo haw --enable-user-scripts
 *   sudo haw --disable-user-scripts
 * Which writes to a 644 FIFO owned by root that hawck listens on.
 * 
 * --disable-user-scripts will unload all user scripts.
 * --enable-user-scripts will allow user scripts to be loaded.
 *
 * OK, new approach:
 *
 *   Because of the /proc/ filesystems the approaches above just
 *   wont work. Disabling /proc is unrealistic as too many things
 *   depend on it. Here is the new approach:
 *
 *   When a script is loaded it is loaded for both the priviliged
 *   reader and the user-level end. The priviliged reader only
 *   runs match() to get an index of which action to take, it then
 *   passes this action to the user mode daemon. This should work
 *   pretty seamlessly. When a match is found the key event information
 *   is also passed, but all of this means that the key event is
 *   only passed in cases where there was an actual match. This makes
 *   installing keyloggers impossible without root access as the scripts
 *   are still owned by root. In this model both daemons have to maintain
 *   their own UDevice.
 *
 *   The two processes still communicate via a shared memory mapping.
 *
 *   The optional feature of disabling all this will still be present.
 *   As will the `haw --enable-user-scripts` option.
